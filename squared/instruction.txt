Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays.
The function should return true if every value in the array
has its corresponding value squared in the second array.
The frequency of values must be the same

Example
same([1, 2, 3], [4, 1, 9]) = true
same([1, 2, 3], [1, 9]) = false
same([1, 2, 1], [4, 4, 1]) = false (must be the same frequency which is [1, 1, 4])
